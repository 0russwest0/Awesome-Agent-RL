### Actual LLM agents are Coming

What are LLM Agents?

Systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.

### The Model is the Product

What is the next cycle of AI development? Agents? Reasoners? Actual multimodality?

I think it's time to call it: the model is the product.
