### Actual LLM agents are coming

> [!TIP]

> [Vintage Data Blog](https://vintagedata.org/blog/posts/designing-llm-agents)

What are LLM Agents?

Systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.

### The Model is the Product

> [!TIP]
>
> [Vintage Data Blog](The Model is the Product)

What is the next cycle of AI development? Agents? Reasoners? Actual multimodality?

I think it's time to call it: the model is the product.

### Farewell to Agentic Workflow?
